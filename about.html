			<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
			<p>The Vacant and Abandoned Building Finder is a tool for helping people and organizations find buildings in Chicago that are not in use and potentially hazardous to the neighborhood around them. </p>
			
			<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
			<p>With the tools on the left column, you can find buildings that are open and unsecured, have fire damage, or are in use by non-residents (gangs, children, homeless, etc). You can also search around an address or intersection and by the date the building was reported.</p>
			<p>On the right side the buildings are potted on a map of Chicago. Each point is clickable and will show you details about when the building was reported, where on the lot it is located, where an open entry point is (if any) as well as a picture of the building itself (courtesy of Google's street view). Additionally, there is a list of resources anyone can use to find more information on the building, or to provide an updated <a href='https://servicerequest.cityofchicago.org/web_intake_chic/Controller?op=locform&invSRType=BBK&invSRDesc=Vacant/Abandoned%20Building&locreq=Y&stnumreqd=Y'>report to 311</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>
			<p>This tool is free and for anyone who is interested in vacant and abandoned buildings in Chicago. It was built with simplicity in mind; you don't have to be an expert in real estate or Chicago building policy to use it. That being said, it can definitely be used by someone who is, and I hope that it proves to be a useful tool.</p>
			
			<p>It could be used in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As an educational tool for the general public to make them aware of the number of vacant and abandoned buildings in Chicago and where they are.</li>
				<li>By firefighters who want to check if a burning building has people (non-residents) reported in it to determine if they should perform a rescue. If there's no one in the building, they won't have to risk their lives.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 id="why-did-you-make-it">Why did you make it?</h2>
			<p>The Oakland Education Cabinet, and its three chairs (Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Dr. Tony Smith, Mayor Jean Quan, and Mills College Dean of Education, Dr. Kathy Schultz) are pleased to share the following interactive map of locations for state and federally funded pre-school programs for three and four year old children. The programs provide part day and full day early education and are free or low cost for qualifying families. The Cabinet encourages everyone in Oakland to share the map with parents and others who are raising children in our city. We know that the first five years of a child’s life is a very important time for learning, and pre-school has been proven to assist children prepare for success in school and life.</p>

			<p>We also want to encourage you to utilize BANANAS Child Care Resource and Referral agency, where parents can receive free referrals to a wide variety of early care and education services, including nannies, family child care, preschools, and playgroups.

			<p>Please note that ECE programs listed are for information only. Parents should visit and check out the programs to see if the family and the program are a “good fit”.</p>
